<!--This is a comment tag. Previously, we have learned about: tags (body, header <h1...h7>, paragraph <p>, line break <br>, images <img>
	unordered <ul> and ordered <ol> lists) and CSS styling (by tag type p { }, by creating ids #id { }, and by creating classes .classes { }).

	Today we reviewed HTML linking, tables and comments. We also learned about CSS font types, sizing and styling (bold/italic).
	Can you find a use for any of these things? Can we create...
	1. Interal links?
	2. External links?
	3. Change font size in two different ways? Which method do you find easier to use?
	4. Change font types?
	5. Add a backup font to the new styling?
	6. Can you think of anything else?
