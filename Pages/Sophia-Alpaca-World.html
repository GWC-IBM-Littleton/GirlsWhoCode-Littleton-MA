 <h2 id="first"> My First Year</h2>
     
   <p> I arrived at hogwarts and went inside the great hall and met Harry Potter and then I sat on the sorting hat's stool. The sorting hat announced that I was in Ravenclaw. On my first day there I had already casted a patronus, which was a hedgehog. My headmistress, McGonagall, used to be the old transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor house. Our house ghost was the grey lady. I liked her. She was always silent, but sometimes she would look at me. She never smiled. But that was okay. I made some friends here. Luna Lovegood was my best friend, even though she was quite odd. I heard that the famous Harry Potter was in Gryffindor, and I wanted to meet him. So one day I went up to him and asked, "Are you Harry Potter?" I looked at the lightning scar on his forehead. It was my first year here, and it was great. At the end of the year, I found out that Harry had found the Sorcerer's stone and Proffeser Quirrel, the defense against the dark arts teacher, was actually evil and helping You-Know-Who. </p>
        <h2 id="second">My Second Year</h2>
   
 <p> It was my second year at hogwarts, and I was considering leaving the school. Students had been disappearing. I heard that Mrs. Norris, Mr. Filch's cat had been petrified. I cowered in my dorm the whole night, studying instead of sleeping. Even Nearly Headless Nick had been petrified, but how, I don't know. The golden trio, as they had started to call them, had lost someone. I think it was the girl. She had disappeared, and I knew that she had most likely been petrified. But I was very happy that we had a trained expert with us, Gilderoy Lockheart. He was amazing! But then I found out he was using the memory charm, obliviate, one people after collecting their story. Horrible! That's when Potter discovered that there was a secret basilisk in an underground chamber that was built by Salazar Slytherin a long time agao, from what I've heard.</p>
       
 <h2 id="third"> My Third Year</h2>
  
<p> Merlin's beard! Sirius Black had escaped! It was so scary! He had murdered <em>twelve</em> people with only a single spell, not to mention that he had <strong>destroyed</strong> Peter Pettigrew. All that was left was his finger. Then Sirius Black came into the school. It was a fright! I'm regretting coming here, but I don't want to leave Luna. Then she would be sad. My owl Birch had dropped the Daily Prophet on my table in the morning, that's how I found out. She had also nibbled off a piece of my toast. I wonder if she was carrying rabies. Anyways, Sirius Black slashed at the Gryffindor portrait, the Fat Lady. I could tell it was dangerous, because everyone was gathered up at the painting. Also, we had a new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, because our second year one, Mr. Lockheart, had lost his memory, the poor thing. I thought maybe there was a curse on the job. Our new teacher was Mr. Lupin, but he had resigned after everyone found out he was a werewolf. Then we got stuck with Professor Snape. His homework demands were so long, but I still enjoyed it. </p>
   
<h2 id="fourth"> My Fourth Year</h2>
      
<p> Yes! The triwizard tournament! I was too young to enter, but I heard that the Weasley twins had tried to step inside Dumbledore's age line, but failed. It was hilarious! I was even there! They grew beards and looked like old men! What bothered me the most though, was that I couldn't enter. Only seventh years! SO UNFAIR! And the prize was 1,000 galleons, no less! I was so jealous when that lousy Harry Potter boy got chosen. Honsetly, how does Cho Chang even like him?! I think he just wants attention for himself. However, when I laid out my reasons for Cho, she got angry and ignored me! AUGH!!! <br>I coulnd't wait for the ball! Some Gryffindor named Percy asked me to the ball, and I, of course, said yes. I picked my dress to be gray, with flowers along the edges and the top covered in lace. I watched all the triwizard competitors (<em>including</em> Potter, mind you) dance in the middle of the ball. Potter went with Parvati Patil, and that friend of his, Ronald Weasley, went with Patil's sister.<br> I regret everything. Being jealous of Potter, wanting to enter the tournament . . . definitely not the tournament. Cedric Diggory . . . Cho was crying for days. Poor girl. She must be traumatized. </p>
