<h2> Alpaca bag for lunch today. </h2>
<h2>Alpacas rule the world. If you don't agree, you're just jealous. </h2>
<p>Have you heard of alpacas? They are the cutest, fuzziest, warmest, most awesome creatures in the world! Llamas are losers. Alpacas are winners. I love alpacas. They are awesome! I have a few things you should consider when comparing alpacas to llamas.</p>
<ol>
<li>Alpacas were bred for their wool, and llamas were bred to be pack animals. </li>
<li>Alpacas are nicer than llamas, and are domesticated creatures. Llamas, on the other hand, are a bit more on the wild side. </li>
