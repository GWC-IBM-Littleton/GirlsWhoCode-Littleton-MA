        <h6>02/20/2030</h6>

<div class="article">
<p>Something exciting happened. </p>

        <p>Honestly, I never expected this to happen, although I bet some of my
 friends would disagree. I got accepted into high school a year earlier!</p>

        <p>I'm skipping a grade. </p>

        <p>I'm actually, <i>actually</i> skipping a grade. 8th grade at least.
I don't think I would like it anyway. It seems boring, and I want to actually
learn something instead of looking blankly at the whiteboard and being the only
person actually <i>using my <b>brain</b></i>.</p>

        <p>Anyway, I'll get back to you guys later!</p>

        <p>Peace!</p>

        <h2 id="secondpost">Second Post: Making 'Looping'</h2>

        <h6>06/14/2030</h6>
<div class="article">
        <p>Sorry, my fellow blogger-people, or whatever you want me to call
 you.</p>

        <p><i>I've just been involved in making a comic.</i></p>

        <p>It's called Looping by the way, if you would like to check it out.</p>

        <p>Buuut... it's not released to the public yet, so you guys have to wait
 a while.</p>

        <p>Considering you guys want to <b>read</b> it anyway.</p>

        <p>Have a nice summer! I know I'm not because... preparing for
high school and all that... <i>yeeeaaahhh</i> it's gonna be a nice school year.</p>

		<h2 id="thirdpost">Third Post: School Tour</h2>
	<h6>07/24/2030</h6>

<div class="article">
	<p>Hello peoples, once again. </p>
	<p>I'm not dead, don't worry about that. I'm still a living, breathing
creature. </p>
	<p><i>Sadly.</i></p>
	<p>Anyways, this is not the time to dwell on me being alive.</p>
	<p>It is time to dwell on the fact that I'm going to school once again.</p>
	<p><b><i>Ughhhhh....</i></b></p>
	<p>My parents dragged me to a school - it's called Silver Leaf. What kind
of boring school name is that? It sounds like it came out of a fairy tale.</p>
	<p>It is a Roman Catholic school, meaning the students <i>have</i>
to take a class of religion each year. In 9th grade, we have to learn about
the Bible.</p>
	<p>I'm not saying that it is boring, otherwise I would be offending
people. Far from that actually. I'm just saying I'm not really looking forward
to school. Honestly, I just want to hibernate through winter, just like bears
and squirrels do.</p>
	<p>The school isn't half-bad. It is really big, and it has two gymnasiums!
 The hallways are also so weird, like there is an <b>Even Wing</b> and an <b>Odd
Wing</b> and a <b>Garden Wing</b>.</p>
	<p>And, the staircases are so weirdly organized it's gonna take me a heck
 of a long time to get used to it. Honestly, how do people get used to such
a school?</p>
	<p>Then again, it isn't gonna be my only option. I'm gonna be looking
at other schools too. I am going to be a computer engineer, making giant
robots and stuffs like that.</p>
	<p>Anyway, see y'all later! I'm gonna have fun trying out other schools
and seeing what AP courses I'm gonna take.<p>
	<p><i>Fun.</i></p>
	<p>Angie out.</p>

		<h2 id="fourthpost">Fourth Post: First Day</h2>
	<h6>09/02/2030</h6>
<div class="article">
	<p>This was one of the not-so-bad first days of school.</p>
	<p>Then again, I've never had the <b>worst</b> day of school of my
life, like how in some books the girl/boy/whatever-gender-I-don't-even-care
has the <i>absolute</i> worst day ever. Late to school because alarm clock didn't
wake the person up, Mom or Dad also didn't wake the person up, bad hair day,
bullies, and crazy stuffs like that.</p>
	<p>Nope. Not to normal-Angela here.</p>
	<p>The cycle is an 8-day cycle. First period one day, eighth period
another day, second period another, yadda-yadda-yadda you get what I mean. </p>
	<p>I haven't made any friends, and I'd rather not - <i>yet</i> - until
 I know if they are good for me or not.</p>
	<p>Yes I'm a loner but what else is new?</p>
	<p>Anyway instead of talking about some gossip on what's new on YouTube
and Instagram I can get started on my homework and get my GPA up.</p>
	<p>That's probably going to change in the coming years, but, what can
you do.</p>
	<p>All the hallways are so confusing I was <i>almost</i> late to every
class. Note that I said <i>almost</i>. That's because I just followed people that
said in their loud conversations that were in my next class. Thankfully
they were not late or else I would have been late.</p>
	<p>And that definitely won't look good since I'm supposed to be supersmart
because I've skipped 8th grade.</p>
	<p>There's a <b><i>ton</i></b> of homework that the teachers have been
giving us. Some students have been whining as if it's been a long haul. It isn't
that much, really. I mean, that's what you've signed up for.</p>
	<p>Oh yeah, I forgot to write this up, but I'm too lazy to put it back.</p>
	<p>I am in Silver Leaf - I was too lazy to go to other schools so I
just came here.</p>
	<p>Anyway, I have to go do some homeworks.</p>
	<p>So fun, isn't it.</p>
	<p>So not looking forward to mid-terms.</p>
