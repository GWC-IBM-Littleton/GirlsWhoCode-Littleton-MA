 <h2 id="first"> My First Year</h2>
     
   <p> I arrived at hogwarts and went inside the great hall and met Harry Potter and then I sat on the sorting hat's stool. The sorting hat announced that I was in Ravenclaw. On my first day there I had already casted a patronus, which was a hedgehog. My headmistress, McGonagall, used to be the old transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor house. Our house ghost was the grey lady. I liked her. She was always silent, but sometimes she would look at me. She never smiled. But that was okay. I made some friends here. Luna Lovegood was my best friend, even though she was quite odd. I heard that the famous Harry Potter was in Gryffindor, and I wanted to meet him. So one day I went up to him and asked, "Are you Harry Potter?" I looked at the lightning scar on his forehead. It was my first year here, and it was great. At the end of the year, I found out that Harry had found the Sorcerer's stone and Proffeser Quirrel, the defense against the dark arts teacher, was actually evil and helping You-Know-Who. </p>
        <h2 id="second">My Second Year</h2>
   
 <p> It was my second year at hogwarts, and I was considering leaving the school. Students had been disappearing. I heard that Mrs. Norris, Mr. Filch's cat had been petrified. I cowered in my dorm the whole night, studying instead of sleeping. Even Nearly Headless Nick had been petrified, but how, I don't know. The golden trio, as they had started to call them, had lost someone. I think it was the girl. She had disappeared, and I knew that she had most likely been petrified. But I was very happy that we had a trained expert with us, Gilderoy Lockheart. He was amazing! But then I found out he was using the memory charm, obliviate, one people after collecting their story. Horrible! That's when Potter discovered that there was a secret basilisk in an underground chamber that was built by Salazar Slytherin a long time agao, from what I've heard.</p>
       
 <h2 id="third"> My Third Year</h2>
  
<p> Merlin's beard! Sirius Black had escaped! It was so scary! He had murdered <em>twelve</em> people with only a single spell, not to mention that he had <strong>destroyed</strong> Peter Pettigrew. All that was left was his finger. Then Sirius Black came into the school. It was a fright! I'm regretting coming here, but I don't want to leave Luna. Then she would be sad. My owl Birch had dropped the Daily Prophet on my table in the morning, that's how I found out. She had also nibbled off a piece of my toast. I wonder if she was carrying rabies. Anyways, Sirius Black slashed at the Gryffindor portrait, the Fat Lady. I could tell it was dangerous, because everyone was gathered up at the painting. Also, we had a new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, because our second year one, Mr. Lockheart, had lost his memory, the poor thing. I thought maybe there was a curse on the job. Our new teacher was Mr. Lupin, but he had resigned after everyone found out he was a werewolf. Then we got stuck with Professor Snape. His homework demands were so long, but I still enjoyed it. </p>
   
<h2 id="fourth"> My Fourth Year</h2>
      
<p> Yes! The triwizard tournament! I was too young to enter, but I heard that the Weasley twins had tried to step inside Dumbledore's age line, but failed. It was hilarious! I was even there! They grew beards and looked like old men! What bothered me the most though, was that I couldn't enter. Only seventh years! SO UNFAIR! And the prize was 1,000 galleons, no less! I was so jealous when that lousy Harry Potter boy got chosen. Honsetly, how does Cho Chang even like him?! I think he just wants attention for himself. However, when I laid out my reasons for Cho, she got angry and ignored me! AUGH!!! <br>I coulnd't wait for the ball! Some Gryffindor named Percy asked me to the ball, and I, of course, said yes. I picked my dress to be gray, with flowers along the edges and the top covered in lace. I watched all the triwizard competitors (<em>including</em> Potter, mind you) dance in the middle of the ball. Potter went with Parvati Patil, and that friend of his, Ronald Weasley, went with Patil's sister.
<br> I regret everything. Being jealous of Potter, wanting to enter the tournament . . . definitely not the tournament. Cedric Diggory . . . Cho was crying for days. Poor girl. She must be traumatized. </p>
    
<h2 id="fifth"> My Fifth Year</h2>
<p>As I got onto the train at Hogwarts, I briefly remembered Cho Chang. What I found odd was that that Malfoy boy was prefect. Of course, I was also prefect, but you get what I mean. Dumbledore was kicked from his position as Headmaster (which I found totally unfair) and replaced by some witch named Umbridge. And I mean a <em>literal</em> witch. I heard that she used some magicked quills that wrote with the students blood for those who had detention! Now, back to prefects. Obviously, I take my prefect duties seriously, not just to give detention out to whomever I want. Logically, that would be unfair, becaus ethere really is no reason to be giving out detentions anyways if they aren't doing something bad, and, plus, that would mean that . . . I'm getting off track. Oh, that reminds me of something ! THe other day, I heard that Hermione Granger and her friends were going to some place in Hogsmeade. I may not be a fan of Potter, but Granger's smarts can match mine! 
<br> When I met them at the designated place, I had to shove through a crowd of people to get a good look. Apparently, Potter wanted to start some sort of secret alliance against that old hag Umbridge. I was no friend of Potter's, but there was no way I'd miss a chance to annoy Umbridge!</p>
   
<h2 id="sixth"> My Sixth Year</h2>
<p>Dumbledore asked me to come to some private lessons with Potter. I had suspected he would ask this, since he said that he needed some help investigating, which implied that he is probably looking for something, like clues. I think that he's rying to find <em>horcruxes</em>, because You-Know-Who killed wizards and witches, but have you ever wondered for what reason? I suspect that he wanted to become immortal, but couldn't quite do it. So, instead, he trapped parts of his soul in horcruzes, items that hold parts of his soul. It explains why he used Professor Quirrel, at least, because he was drinking unicorn blood and was trying to steal the sorcerer's stone. Anyway, I wasn't ver excited about having private lessons with Potter, and he didn't seem very happy either. But, my theory was confirmed. Professor Dumbledore wanted us to find these horcruxes and find this old man, Professor Slughorn, who was the old potions teachers. I think that he might have been the one who told the Dark Lord about horcruxes, because when Harry came back with te memory, it was really hazy, so I think he might have messed the memory into a fake one. Which is why I was sent to retrieve the memory again. As I made my way to where Professor Slughorn was (Hagrid's Hut), I managed to slip inside. "So," I said casually. "Professor, you really are amazing at teaching potions." I continued to persuade him, until finally he gave up and the memory was soon in a glass bottle in my hands, and I was off toward the Headmaster's office. 
<br>I was crying for days. I couldn't believe it. Dumbledoe, greatest wizard of all time, a hero in my eyes, was dead. I didn't believe it. But he was. </p>
<h2 id="seventh"> My Seventh Year </h2>
<p>I didn't very well go to any of my classes. I was one of the few hundreds who survived the Second Wizarding War. But my life cost my best friend's. Peanut, my owl, flew in front of me and was hit by the death curse. Maybe next year we can start to rebuild Hogwarts, because I sure do think that the kids next year have to have a good full seventh years without any of the danger that I had to go through.</p>
