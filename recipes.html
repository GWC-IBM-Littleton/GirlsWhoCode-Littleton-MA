<p> Most do not use any extra cooking methods for MEAT and just eat it raw after using the proper spells. However, I will show you some methods that may add extra flavour to your MEAT
</p>

    
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> The simplest recipe for MEAT is to ferment it with in a 500 year old barrel made of the bones of various gods. The amount of time to ferment is up to you. I would recommend letting it sit for around 3-5 years.</p>
    
    
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> This is a more complicated recipe, as it requires the source meat to have been harvested on a new moon at exactly 3:19 AM. Once the meat is acquired, bury it in a nearby forest for 13 days(make sure it is deep enough so that the scavengers cannot reach it!) While waiting, soak the ceremonial dagger in ocean water(for best results, use water from the Mariana Trench, be sure to ask for permission from the local gods!) Once the meat is done fermenting, use the dagger to cut the meat up into small, bite-sized chunks.</p>
    
    
<p>Once everything is finished, use your favorite flavouring spells and enjoy! Method 2 goes particularly well in a salad!</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pour the Dr. Pepper into a medium saucepan and heat to about 180-degrees F. (The carbonation will make it look like it's boiling but you can ignore this if you use a thermometer).</p>
    
   
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pour the hot Dr. Pepper into a glass and drop in the lemon slices. Enjoy!</p>
